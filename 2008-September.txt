Message-ID: <48D90192.6040703@ugent.be>

Hi, pyFormex lover,

We're happy to announce the 0.7.2 release of pyFormex.
As usual, this new release comes with a bunch of enhancements and new 
features.
There are also some bug fixes and quite a few new examples.
Especially have a look at the SuperShape example (there is a screenshot 
on the website).
This release installs with Python 2.4 or 2.5 (tested on Debian and Ubuntu).
For more details on the changes in this release, see the 
doc/ReleaseNotes file.
