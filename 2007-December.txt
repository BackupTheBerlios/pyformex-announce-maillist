Subject: [Pyformex-announce] Reviving the pyFormex Forums and Mailing Lists
Message-ID: <475516DB.80107@ugent.be>

Hi,

Now that pyFormex development has come into third gear and the 
development team has grown in such way that oral communication alone is 
no longer effective in keeping everyone updated, we decided to revive 
the pyFormex Developer Forum and pyFormex Announcement Mailing List.

The pyFormex Developer Forum is accessible at 
https://developer.berlios.de/forum/?group_id=2717
(You need to be logged in as developer on BerliOS to see the Developer 
Forum.)
This forum should become the preferential communication channel about
pyFormex development.
Developers can monitor the Forum (and we advise to do so: click the 
monitor button on the Forum page), to have the Forum messages sent to 
their mail address.

Messages to the pyFormex Announcement Mailing List should be sent to
pyformex-announce at lists.berlios.de. They will be sent to all people
subscribed to the list (not just developers).

I took the liberty to add all the developers to the Mailing List.
You can change your preferences (or even unsubscribe) at 
https://developer.berlios.de/mail/?group_id=2717

Benedict
