Message-ID: <4838397C.9030008@ugent.be>

pyFormex 0.7.1 has just been released !

Most prominent changes in this release (as compared to 0.7) are:
- reviewed properties plugin, whose API has now become fairly stable
- accelerated drawing/picking through the compiled library
- initiation of a postprocessing framework.

Enjoy!
